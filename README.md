## Overview
The Tableau story can be viewed here https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jimmy5146/viz/NYCCitiBIkeAnalysisbyJimmyD_Greer/NYCCitiBikeAnalysis#1

In this project we used bikeshar data for the motnh of August in New York City to present to investors who are interested in a bikeshare program. We used our prowess in exploratory analysis to extract information that would be helpful for the investors and used Tableau to visualize our findings.

## Results

### Gender breakdown illustrates that Male's took up more than 50% percent of the bike riders in the month of August in NYC

 ### Peak Hours illustrates the hours when bikes are being rode and also shows the best time for bike repairs

### This visual goes in deeper showing the trip duration broken down by gender

### In this visual it shows that most trips are taken towards the end of the week

### This also goes a step further by breaking down the gender in the trips by week and the times in which each gender are riding

## Summary

This data showed that the best market for investors to target would be male's.

### 2 additional analysis
1. As an investor I would want to know if there was a way I could tap into the female market a little more.
2. Another future analysis would be to take a look at the age of the bike rider's and find some correlation or causations.
